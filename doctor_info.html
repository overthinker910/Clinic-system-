<h4><em>Emergency Medicine</em>
</h4>
<div> 
    I treat my patients and families the same way that I'd like to be treated. I focus on providing a comfortable and safe experience and one in which the patient is able to voice their concerns and symptoms, be examined, with the ability to discuss potential diagnostic testing as required. We work to determine a diagnosis, but more importantly, on what can be done to improve their symptoms, function and what treatment is needed and reasonable.</div>
